# JavaCard Emulator for Android

This is a very simple template project that utilizes
[Android HCE](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce) (Host-based Card Emulation)
and [jCardSim](https://jcardsim.org/) to emulate contactless smart cards with JavaCard support.

For a more complex and full-featured project, see
